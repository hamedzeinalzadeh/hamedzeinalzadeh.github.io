# Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis

## **Introduction to Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq)**

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a groundbreaking technique in molecular biology designed to study gene expression at the individual cell level. Unlike traditional bulk RNA sequencing, which averages gene expression across a population of cells, scRNA-seq provides a high-resolution view of the transcriptome for each cell. This enables researchers to uncover cellular heterogeneity and identify distinct cell types within a complex tissue or sample.

### **Key Benefits of scRNA-seq**
- **Cellular Heterogeneity**: scRNA-seq reveals the diversity of cell types and states within a sample.
- **Rare Cell Populations**: It enables the identification of rare or previously unknown cell types.
- **Dynamic Processes**: Researchers can characterize how cells transition between states during biological processes such as development, disease progression, or treatment response.

### **Advancements in the Field**
The field of scRNA-seq is rapidly evolving. New methods and technologies are continually being developed to enhance:
- **Sensitivity**: Capturing low-abundance transcripts more effectively.
- **Throughput**: Analyzing thousands or even millions of cells in a single experiment.
- **Multimodal Analysis**: Integrating additional molecular features like chromatin accessibility or protein levels alongside gene expression.

## **This Project**
In this project, you will explore the general steps involved in analyzing scRNA-seq data, focusing on two main components:

1. **Preprocessing and Clustering**: Learn the foundational steps of scRNA-seq analysis, such as quality control, normalization, and dimensionality reduction, followed by clustering to group similar cells.
2. **Individual Research Topic**: Select and propose a specific topic for detailed analysis. Suggested topics and guidelines will be provided at the end of this document.

## **Recommended Reading**
To gain a strong understanding of scRNA-seq data analysis, we highly recommend the following tutorial:
